Table: Exam

| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+

(exam_id, student_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the student with student_id had a score points in the exam with id exam_id.

 

A quiet student is the one who took at least one exam and did not score the high or the low score.

Write an SQL query to report the students (student_id, student_name) being quiet in all exams. Do not return the student who has never taken any exam.

Return the result table ordered by student_id.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Student table:
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Daniel        |

| 3           | Stella        |
| 4           | Jonathan      |
| 5           | Will          |
+-------------+---------------+
Exam table:
+------------+--------------+-----------+
| exam_id    | student_id   | score     |
+------------+--------------+-----------+
| 10         |     1        |    70     |
| 10         |     2        |    80     |
| 10         |     3        |    90     |
| 20         |     1        |    80     |

| 40         |     4        |    80     |
+------------+--------------+-----------+
Output: 
+-------------+---------------+
| student_id  | student_name  |

| 2           | Jade          |

Explanation: 
For exam 1: Student 1 and 3 hold the lowest and high scores respectively.
For exam 2: Student 1 hold both highest and lowest score.
For exam 3 and 4: Studnet 1 and 4 hold the lowest and high scores respectively.
Student 2 and 5 have never got the highest or lowest in any of the exams.
Since student 5 is not taking any exam, he is excluded from the result.
So, we only return the information of Student 2.
